# Project information

This project is part of a FullStack developer course. The assignment is to create an App with ReactJS, and in doing so, utilize as many features as possible. The assignment is a group work, and has three main contributors working on it.

This project will be a standard Q&A platform. The features are divided into three categories based on priority, and will be listed below.

# Epic

We need to create a Q&A website, that can accommodate users with questions from a lot of different categories. These questions then need to be able to be answered by other users, and the answers can be rated.

# User stories

- As a visitor to the site I want to be able to browse questions and answers without being forced to log in and/or give my data
- As a user I want to be able to post a question and see all the answers that others post for it.
- As someone who posted a question, I want to be able to choose the answer that fits my question the best and mark it down somehow
- As a user, I want to help others by posting answers to the things I feel I know well
- As a user I want to be able to up- and downvote questions and answers
- As an administrator I want to be able to remove possibly offensive posts
- As a registered user I want to be able to sign in and see my user profile. Editing it would be nice too.
- As a visitor I need to be able to have some kind of search to find if there are posts that might help me.
